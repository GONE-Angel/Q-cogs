# Q-cogs


[Q-cogs](https://cogs.red/cogs/Quintenvw/Q-cogs/) is basically a folder of cogs for [Red](https://cogs.red) made for my server and I felt like sharing.

I make a lot of other cogs aswel, sadly enough I keep them exclusive for Chillbar.

If you find something in there you would like and can't find anywhere else, feel free to [contact](https://github.com/Quintenvw/Q-cogs#contact) me.

I hope you enjoy using the few cogs I posted in here!

xx ~Q
